Sound Equalizer Project
1. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a sound equalizer to run on FPGA, utilizing tools provided by Xilinx. The implementation will be carried out using VHDL and C Embedded languages.
2. Resources

    Zybo Development Board
    VGA Monitor
    Speaker System
    Vivado 2022.1 – VHDL
    Vitis SDK 2022.1 – C Embedded
    Octave or MatLab
    Tera Term

3. Hardware Implementation

    Implementation of the Vivado Block Diagram
    VGA Video for a resolution of 1980x1080px
    Integration with Vitis SDK

4. Software Implementation

    State machine design
    Volume adjustment
    VGA values
    Noise addition
    Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Filter
    Audio storage – 3 seconds
    Audio playback

5. Results

    First part of the state machine: Increase – Decrease – Reset Volume
    Second part of the state machine: Audio storage and playback – 3 seconds
    VGA Video implementation
    Results of VGA Video implementation
    VGA Logic for a resolution of 1980x1080
    Last part of the state machine: Noise addition
    Signal filtering through the EMA filter

6. Conclusions

The successful development of a sound equalizer using Vivado Block Design and Xilinx SDK, with integration on the Zybo development board and VGA monitor. Implementation of the EMA filter along with the Low Pass Filter.
7. Future Developments

    Expansion of video from 8 bars to 20+
    Implementation of additional filters
    Transition from VGA to HDMI
